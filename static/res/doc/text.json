 "(The) User": "I perceive my appearance / profile / structural (physical, mental, astral, etc...) makeup as something which belongs to a class of species we named / call as ‘Human’. But the class of species called ‘Human’ cannot be defined based on my personal perception. i.e. I may claim that I am a Human but I cannot claim that Human is me. 'Human' is a Class and 'I' am an Object of that Class. 'God' also can be defined in such a manner. 'God' is a Class, many Objects exists based on that Class. Every other Classes are Classes inherited from that ('God') Class, 'Human' being one among them. The inheritance is partial/full, depends on the User.<br><br>Who is the User?"
