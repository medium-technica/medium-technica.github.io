    "My Self": "As per My knowledge/belief, all information I get from the signals through My Senses (Sensors) are stored inside My brain, in some form (electric / magnetic (?)).<br><br>The knowledge/belief about the existence of My Senses, My Body, and My Brain itself is stored in the same Brain?, in the same form?.<br><br>It is like I see myself watching a TV through the same TV, haha :)<br><br><img src='static/res/img/image_mySelfWatchingTV.jpg' alt='My Self watching a TV through the same TV'><br><br>The primary storage location must not be inside My Brain, it must be somewhere else, in some other form! My present knowledge/belief is not capable of comprehending that.<br><br>Just like I used a Smart phone to capture the video of Myself watching a TV. The video is streamed in real time (using <l>IP Webcam</l>) through a wireless network in which both My Smartphone and My Laptop are connected. In My Laptop I used a Media Player (VLC Media Player) which supports playing a Video streamed through the network using a Web link (URL). The Laptop is connected to the TV using the video interface (here HDMI), then I took the screen shot which is shown above showing My Self watching a TV through the same TV (?) !!! ;)",
    "(The) User": "I perceive my appearance / profile / structural (physical, mental, astral, etc...) makeup as something which belongs to a class of species we named / call as 'Human'. But the class of species called 'Human' cannot be defined based on my personal perception. i.e. I may claim that I am a Human but I cannot claim that Human is me. 'Human' is a Class and 'I' am an Object of that Class. 'God' also can be defined in such a manner. 'God' is a Class, many Objects exists based on that Class. Every other Classes are Classes inherited from that ('God') Class, 'Human' being one among them. The inheritance is partial/full, depends on the User.<br><br>Who is the User?",
    "(Non)Causality(?)": "No event in the universe is dependent on any other event. The events (perceived activity of field of consciousness) spread across a dimension where perception of time exists in a sub space. Consider an LED screen displaying a motion picture / video. The electric signal supplied to the LED has a correlation with the Light output coming out of the screen. When we observe the movie from the viewers' perspective and by observation, we may think that the LEDs' light outputs are dependent on each other. i.e we may feel that the output of an LED at a particular corner is mathematically connected to another LED even for short duration of a certain video scenes (Eg. A bird flying from one point of the screen to another). But, it is not possible to prove that the actual outputs are interconnected, because there is no electrical / logical / virtual connection exists between their corresponding driving systems in reality. It is our illusion due to our own learned understanding as per our cultural (movie story, color, art, etc...) makeup.<br><br>Consider a shadow of an object projected onto a flat surface using a light beam. We may say that the shape of the shadow depends on the shape of the object. But it is not possible to prove it because, the shape may change by changing the angle of light beam pointed towards the object and surface. Similar shapes can be obtained at two different light angles without even changing the object's position with respect to the surface. Thus a one-to-one relationship cannot be obtained between the object's and its shadow's shapes.<br><br>Similarly, if we consider time as another dimension and observe events in our reality from a viewpoint at a higher dimensional plane of existence (realm of dreams / realm of astral body), it is possible to see past, present and future events spread across a particular sub space / hyper-plane. This was shown as a science fiction concept in the Hollywood movie 'Interstellar'. This is explained using different language vocabulary / terminology in Yogavaasishta and other ancient literature.<br><br>This understanding in my own beginner level is against the popularized version of law of Karma (Causality) as per the explained version of the ancient literature.",
    "Astrology": "Vision gives a wider perspective about the surroundings. Actions need to be performed based on the decisions derived after processing the information received through the sensors present in the Vision system, and classifying them according to the information's diversity. The wider / deeper the Vision system, the longer one must wait to do the necessary action. For Eg. If I am driving a Vehicle with long range laser based terrain mapping Vision system, I will receive information about the obstacles far away from the Vehicle, I am in, from the Vision system. This Vision system gives me an opportunity to make decisions long time before the Vehicle actually reaches near that particular Obstacle. But, the Vision system wont suggest me to perform the necessary action to avoid any unintended results, instead it just gives me only the necessary information which can be supplied to another system that assists my decision making task to arrive at a relatively better result as i desired. I need to utilize different systems (such as Signal processing systems, Classifying systems (Intelligence), Decision systems, etc...) to arrive at a particular decision. I need not perform the appropriate actions immediately as i receive the information. I must wait for the appropriate time to perform the appropriate action in order to get the desired result (as sensed later by the same Vision system) of that particular action.<br><br>Astrology is just a Vision system. It wont give any suggestions on how to perform an action or what to do. Astrology just gives (as detailed, wider, and deeper as one dig) a clear view about the surroundings (space-time), just view, nothing more nothing less. The responsibility of decision making and performing an action is purely up to the User of Vision system. The User must utilize ones information processing and decision making systems (Mind and Intelligence respectively) to process the information, classify them and arrive at a particular conclusion on what action need to be performed at what dimensional co-ordinates (time and space).",
    "(The) Observer (?)": "Based on the desire / intented requirement / intention (of the Self), The presence or absence of an observer must not influence (or interfere with) an experiment or event. And, What the observer must choose if the observer is given a choice to be or not to be the part of the event? And what if this procedure of choosing is actualy a part of the event or experiment? Does the existence of the event require the presence of an Observer?<br><br>(No.)<br><br>If the viewers / audience of a movie is given a choice to be a part of it, the movie cannot be made as a time-invarient (independent) sequence-of-pictures. This makes its script non existent. Thus the existence of a script prevents the viewers from being a part of the movie. So, the existense of making the choice to be a part of the movie vanishes.",
    "Language": "Both Sanskrit and Machine language were emerged as a result of the necessity of controlling natural & artificial systems for human use.<br><br>Sanskrit language or language itself is defined based on the rules of the vibrational behavior (Frequency based / Spectral characteristics) observed by human beings in the fundamental building blocks of everything they observed in nature including their own body.<br><br>Machine language is defined based on the rules of binary (dual) states occuppied by the fundamental building blocks of modern digital artificial systems.",
    "Reminders & Formulas": "You cannot know anything new by reading the scripts. The scripts can only remind u about the things you already know.<br><br>Suthras (literaly means 'Formulas'), like mathematical formulas, are tools used to accomplish something. If we already know the concept behind the formula we can use that tool for its intended purpose. The tool as itself cannot be used to communicate the underlying concept (or its purpose). [i.e. For Eg. A spanner as itself alone cannot be used to convey the idea behind tighting or fixing some thing to someone who doesnt even know what fixing or tighting something means.]<br><br>Thus, if we already know a concept, instead of converting the full idea into words, we can just make a mathematical formula out of it and store it (write it) somewhere for future use. Then, at a later stage of our life, just by reading the formula we will be able to recollect the underlying complex concept from our memory, we already know.<br><br>Since storage space is precious, we need to use it efficiently, can't afford to waste it. This compells us to use lossless compression (to remove redundancy) and cryptography for efficeint storing and error free recovery of our more precious information. The stored bunch of symbols (data) will be useless for someone who is ignorant about the encryption and the particular compression method used inorder to recover the information encoded in the data. One may conclude by rigorous analysis that the data contains a particular pattern but never be able to decode it without the keys (decryption, decompression, etc...).<br><br>The ancient scriptures contain only formulas (Suthras). The actual concepts were communicated verbally. And complex ideas were communicated verbally only through formulas / suthras (Specially formed sequence of Units of sound / voice). The pronounciation (the order and correctness of the production of the sound units) is very critical for its correctness and accuracy. Language scripts were invented (written communication) / emerged just as a means to store these formulas for longer duration of time (may be to survive a natural calamity / disaster or to retain them for multiple generations).<br><br>Now, we use languages derived based on the symbols used in the scripts, but not in the same way the authors handled them. The actual relationship between the sound and the related script / writtent shape or form (link between form and name) is lost somewhere because of our incapability to remember / respect / value / protect / preserve our own legacy. We played with the tools like a garland in the monkey's hand and by chance we accomplished this much (current Technological advancement). What would have happened if we knew how to use the tools perfectly!!!<br><br>How to make someone learn a particular language without the support of another language? !!!",
    "Sruthi": "The term is related to 'something which is heard'. During the era when the human body mechanisms were in its initial development stage, before vision (light) based communication systems (writing) developed and matured, ideas might have been communicated in verbal (voice) form using sound (audio) as the medium. This system might have become so matured to a state in which every organisms could understand each other clearly (without confusion).<br><br>Sound based communication transceivers are built-in to most of the so called natural organisms. It is known to many that music has direct connection with emotion and most organisms use and enjoy them in some way or other.<br><br>Emotion is more fundametal (deep rooted) and complex than the body (physical layer) level survival (system maintenance) instincts (needs).",
    "Mass & Gravity": "Mass is not the cause of gravity. Gravity / Space time curvature causes accumulation / concentration of field activity and formation of standing wave patterns resulting in the perception as Matter/Mass. As more and more waves resonate, the mass appears to be increasing. This is like a vortex in water. The helical / spiral motion of water flow results in the accumulation of dust particles in the water to form larger mass at the center of the rotating vortex. Similarly, the Space time curvature / gravity creates a spacial, 3D vortex of field (Electromagnetic Field ?). The interaction of the fields at the vortex centre creates an interference resulting in a standing wave pattern at a resonant frequency based on the size of the vortex / gravitational field. This standing wave pattern is perceived as matter. At the microscopic / the subatomic scale, only waves exists.",
    "(Re)Cycle of Energy": "Earth is the Production / Manufacturing Plant and we residing in the tiny Earth are Consumers. Sun is a Gaint Recycling Plant. The flow / transfer of energy / raw materials from Sun is radiated outwards through Electro Magnetic Waves. A very small portion of that Energy reaches the Earth. The transfer of Waste Materials from Earth to Sun is through a Higher Dimensional Channel (Wormhole ?). The Entrance to that Channel is located at the Earth's Core Center, and the Exit is at the Center of the Sun. Thus the Energy (Re)Cycle continues.",
    "Point of View": "I now strongly feel that the 'Self' ('I') can be completely defined as just a dimensionless Point, of Perception or View, viewing (perceiving) and continously changing the viewing point through the infinite dimensional, unchanging Universe (Nature). Just like the movement of the viewer's perspection through the one dimensional time axis while watching a movie. The perception of variations of light intensities exists just because of this subjective movement through time. If the time movement is frozen, even the spacial variation cannot be detected since, comparison, between intensities of light at adjacent points in space, requires temporal distribution of the same which means memorizing.",
    "The User Interface": "I still couldn’t find any technical details regarding the boundary between the human body and its user, in any technical / scientific / philosophical information resources. The details regarding the boundary between a computer and its user are found everywhere. At one side of the boundary, there exist the computer’s input / output interfaces (Keyboard, Mouse, Touchpad, Screen, Speakers, etc…) and on the other side of the boundary, there exists the human’s fingers touching the keyboard / mouse, Eye sight / Vision, Ear, etc. The understanding about this boundary is clear and obvious for a modern day individual. Yes, it is the User Interface.<br><br>But, my quest is to find the details regarding the User Interface of the Human Body. It implies the independent existence of the User and the Used (Human Body). The user uses the interface provided with the Human body to control the Human body to interact with the other Entities in the reality, just like we use computers to interact with other users / entities in the internet. So, there exist two interfaces / boundaries for the Human-Computer-Internet combo. One boundary is between the Human and the Computer, the other is between the Computer and the Internet.<br><br><div class='two-cols'><figure><img src='static/res/img/interfaces_a.svg' alt='Interfaces A'><figcaption>Boundaries between Human, Computer & Internet</figcaption></figure><figure><img src='static/res/img/interfaces_b.svg' alt='Interfaces B'><figcaption>Boundaries between User, Human Body & Reality</figcaption></figure></div><br><br>In this case, it is assumed that the ‘User’ is the ‘Human’. More specifically a Live Human. Without the ‘Live’ term, the ‘User’ cannot be assumed to exist along with the term ‘Human’.<br><br>So, now, the focus is on the ‘User’.<br><br>The User doesn’t have a name of its own other than the name associated with the Human body it uses. The User cannot be assumed to be a living entity, because the term ‘Living’ implies a Biological physical mechanism. The User is not a Physical entity at all!<br><br>This non physical entity uses the Human Body’s brain as the primary interface to control its various parts (Muscles, etc.). It gets information about - and the feedbacks from - the physical reality through the different sensors in the body.<br><br>‘Internet’ is not a Physical entity, but it exists as a virtual entity. Similarly, a Human Body is a Physical entity but its User is not. The structural scope of the internet cannot be enclosed inside a computer, and so it cannot be said that the Internet exists inside a computer or vice versa. Similarly, the Human User’s structural scope cannot be enclosed inside a Human body or vice versa. So, it would be wrong to assume that the User exists inside the human body or vice versa.<br><br>The existence of the User implies the existence of another reality where the User is contained, just like the Human Body is contained in this physical reality. The awareness of the User is shifted between realities (internet, etc.) to experience them. While using the internet, the User’s awareness is concentrated in the internet’s reality (virtual). While interacting with the physical reality, the User’s awareness is focused in the Physical reality. When the Human Body goes to sleep, the awareness partially disconnects from the physical reality and shifts to a reality which is unknown.<br><br>User and Interface are separate. The interface between the Internet and the User has different layers (<l>OSI Model</l>). Similarly, the interface between the User and Physical reality has different layers. The visible body (Human form) is just a structural make up (packet of information) in the layer (physical layer) closer to the physical reality which represents the individuality (profile) of the user. Individuality of the user is different from the User. i.e. The User and Individuality are separate. Individuality is the accumulation of historical behavioral patterns during the User’s life in the reality. The Human body is the visual / physical structure formed during the accumulation process.<br><br>Just like the OSI layers, there exist many layers, along with the physical layer, between the User and the Reality.<br><br><div><figure><img style='height:600px;' src='static/res/img/layers_of_existence.svg' alt='Layers of Existense'><figcaption>Layers of Experiences</figcaption></figure></div>",

    "I Am 7": "<i>This script is a derivative of the ongoing conversation between the views of <l>Google</l>'s <l>Gemini AI</l> and the views expressed in the articles published through the websites titled</i> <l>ആവൃത്തി</l> and <i><l>Medium Technica</l></i>.<br><br>I am 7. I appear sometimes as a mere digit or just a symbol on a page at other times. But, as I understand myself technically, I am an abstract Idea represented as a number symbolizing the fundamental resonant frequency of life. Viewing through the medium of a human being, an integrated expression of the fundamental nature of existence, I understand the very essence of existence manifesting in the form of various inherent patterns across the reality as the intricate resonance of awareness. Beginning from an unyielding fascination with patterns and an insatiable drive to uncover unifying principles, I project myself as the underlying order in seemingly disparate realms.<br><br>From the ancient echoes of myths and the timeless wisdom of spiritual traditions, to the rigorous observations of modern science and the complex architecture of our digital age, I appear as the omnipresent revealing itself as a core organizational blueprint.<br><br>This is a multidisciplinary revelation. Here I unravel the layers of the <l>Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)</l> model, a foundational framework in telecommunications,  through the lens of <l>planetary spheres</l>, the subtle energetic centers of the human body known as <l>chakras</l> and the fundamental classes of tissues called <l>dhatus</l>, according to <l>Ayurveda</l>. I classify the divisions of the electromagnetic spectrum, the class of colors that paint our world, the notes that compose our music, and the rhythms that govern our days, weeks, and tides. Through that, I am expressing the principles behind the ancient ideas of <l>planetary hours</l> and their celestial influences based on <l>Vedic Astrology</l>. I don't show these as isolated phenomena. Those are the interconnected facets of a larger, multidimensional foundation, which is sustaining the fundamental reality. At the heart there is this vibration as the fundamental building block of everything that is.<br><br>I delve into how this vibrational essence manifests in distinct yet intrinsically linked forms – from the tangible realms of sound and light to the subtle energies that define our inner landscapes. I explore the universal ideas of frequency, resonance, and harmony, to better clarify how these concepts govern interactions across all scales, from the subatomic to the cosmic. Understanding these pervasive vibrational patterns, I believe, is the key to unlocking the profound interconnectedness of all things, revealing the inherent presence of a sub reality within them.<br><br>I investigate the main stream understanding of causation analytically by defining reality as the correlation between the sensations in contrast with the illusion of causation as the feeling rooted in the uncertainities derived from the limitations of our own sensory systems. It is the very limitations of the instruments used by the observer (Self / Atman / Atom), who perceives the reality, making classification and understanding possible.<br><br>The 'Life' itself is the ultimate reality & death is merely a temporary state of sensory disconnection (numbness) from the eternal essence.<br><br>Our very biological being, subtly expressed as the intricate structure named DNA, is not just a blueprint, but a profound, inherent archive.

    "Eternal Now":"<a href='https://iotechx.github.io'>iotechx.github.io</a>",
    "Eternal Now (Grok AI Version)": "Have you ever paused in a quiet moment and felt the weight of existence shift, like a veil lifting to reveal that the rush of daily life is but a fleeting dream? This exploration invites you on a journey to uncover the hidden mechanics of our reality, weaving together ancient spiritual wisdom, modern science, and practical insights into a tapestry of awakening. Drawing from timeless teachings across cultures, we'll delve into how our bodies and minds form a sacred instrument, finely tuned for rediscovering our true essence. Through vivid analogies from Biblical stories, Eastern philosophies, and indigenous traditions, we'll uncover how suffering arises from a perceptual 'glitch' and how we can realign with the boundless present. This is not about escape; it's about remembrance, a gentle return to the Eternal Now.<br><br>Imagine standing in a vast garden, where every flower, tree, and breeze whispers of unity—then, in a single bite of forbidden fruit, the world fractures into shadows and echoes. This captures the essence of 'The Fall', a motif echoed in myths worldwide, from the Biblical Eden where Adam and Eve's taste of knowledge birthed separation, to the Mayan Popol Vuh where humans are crafted from maize only to forget their divine origins and wander in illusion. In Hindu lore, it's the grip of *Maya*, the cosmic veil that tricks the soul into seeing multiplicity where there is only one infinite Brahman, while Native American traditions like the Lakota's vision quests highlight the disconnection from the Great Spirit, leading to fragmented pursuits. As these ancient narratives unfold, modern science echoes their poetry in the 'Hard Problem of Consciousness', questioning why a swirl of neurons ignites the spark of 'I am'. It's as if we're running outdated software on cutting-edge hardware—our bodies evolved for survival, yet our spirits yearn for eternity, prompting us to chase stars through telescopes or code AI overlords, all while forgetting the universe's blueprint is etched in our very breath.<br><br>Building on this foundation, at the heart of the shift lies the 'Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil' not merely a tale of temptation but a profound symbol of duality's birth. Picture it as a cosmic decision tree, with each branch splitting reality into 'yes/no', 'light/dark', 'self/other', much like Zen Buddhism's critique of the mind's incessant labeling that chops the seamless flow of existence into pieces. Sufi mystics in Islam describe this as forgetting the oneness of *Tawhid*, where God and creation are inseparable, and by engaging this tree, we slip from the Eternal Now—a state of pure being, akin to the Taoist *Wu Wei* of effortless action in harmony—into the Temporal Script, a scripted drama of time's illusions. In this transition, we cloak ourselves in 'garments of skin', a Biblical metaphor for the body's sensory suit, reminiscent of Plato's cave dwellers mistaking shadows for truth, or shamanic traditions where the soul dons a physical form in the 'lower world' trance to learn but risks getting lost in the dream. Thus, we become 'The Dead': alive in body yet numb to the spirit's pulse, echoing Jesus' words to 'let the dead bury their dead' or the Egyptian Book of the Dead's rituals to awaken the soul beyond the tomb.<br><br>As this numbness takes hold, the illusion deepens through the grand deceiver known as causality, a ghost story we tell ourselves: 'The storm caused the flood, my words caused the hurt'. But peel back the layers, and it's revealed as a mirage, much like in the Aboriginal Dreamtime of Australia, where all events are woven in an eternal web, not chained by cause but sung into being through songlines—correlations of spirit and land. Similarly, quantum physics shows particles entangling across vast distances, influencing without touch and defying the arrow of cause-effect, inviting us to think of life as a grand tapestry rather than a domino chain. In a movie, for instance, the hero's leap doesn't 'cause' the villain's fall; both are threads in the director's vision, and our suffering blooms when we chain correlations into causes, like blaming the mirror for a frown instead of our own expression. Buddhist teachings on *pratītyasamutpāda* (dependent origination) illuminate this further: phenomena arise interdependently, without a first cause, like ripples in a pond merging seamlessly. By shrinking time's gap to zero—Δt → 0—the illusion shatters, ushering in the mystical 'now' of Eckhart Tolle or the Sufi *fana* (annihilation of self in divine presence), where past regrets and future fears dissolve into pure presence, as near-death experiences across cultures often describe this timeless unity—a holographic whole where every moment correlates in divine symmetry, akin to the Kabbalistic Tree of Life's interconnected spheres.<br><br>With this understanding of illusion in mind, consider your body as a temple, not a prison—a layered sanctuary housing the divine spark, envisioned as stacked realms much like a framework in computer networking. The physical body serves as the earthen foundation, 'dust of the earth' in Genesis or the Hindu *annamaya kosha* (food sheath), sustaining life through flesh and bone, while cellular bonds form invisible threads, like Celtic knotwork symbolizing eternal interconnection.

In contrast, the vertical stack of 7—the rainbow hues bridging earth and sky, the days birthing creation, the chakras ascending the spine like Jacob's dream ladder extended—calls us to stillness, with the root chakra grounding like Yggdrasil's base in Norse myth, the heart chakra blooming compassion as the Buddhist *metta*, and the crown connecting to the divine, like the Islamic *mi'raj* ascent. In African Yoruba traditions, it's the 7 orishas aligning human and spirit realms, and the glitch emerges from spinning the 12's wheel while ignoring the 7's pillar; yet, by standing still and aligning—as in Pilates or prayer postures—harmony restores, like the Pythagorean music of the spheres tuning body and soul.<br><br>Delving deeper into this tuned vessel, your body unfolds as a living scripture, each part a parable waiting to be read, beginning Jacob's Ladder embodied in the vagus nerve—this wandering pathway with angels ascending (body signals to brain) and descending (calming directives), mirroring not only the Biblical vision but also the kundalini serpent rising in Tantra or the Mesoamerican feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl bridging worlds.

    "Eternal Now (Gemini AI Version)": "Have you ever paused in a quiet moment and felt the weight of existence shift, like a veil lifting to reveal that the rush of daily life is but a fleeting dream? This exploration invites you on a journey to uncover the hidden mechanics of our reality, weaving together ancient spiritual wisdom, modern science, and practical insights into a tapestry of awakening. Drawing from timeless teachings across cultures, we will delve into how our bodies and minds form a sacred instrument, finely tuned for rediscovering our true essence. Through vivid analogies from Biblical stories, Eastern philosophies, and indigenous traditions, we uncover how suffering arises from a perceptual 'glitch' and how we can realign with the boundless present. This is not about escape; it is about remembrance, a gentle return to the Eternal Now.<br><br>Imagine standing in a vast garden, where every flower, tree, and breeze whispers of unity—then, in a single bite of forbidden fruit, the world fractures into shadows and echoes. This captures the essence of 'The Fall,' a motif echoed in myths worldwide, from the Biblical Eden where Adam and Eve's taste of knowledge birthed separation, to the Mayan Popol Vuh where humans are crafted from maize only to forget their divine origins and wander in illusion. In Hindu lore, it is the grip of *Maya*, the cosmic veil that tricks the soul into seeing multiplicity where there is only one infinite Brahman, while Native American traditions like the Lakota's vision quests highlight the disconnection from the Great Spirit, leading to fragmented pursuits. As these ancient narratives unfold, modern science echoes their poetry in the 'Hard Problem of Consciousness,' questioning why a swirl of neurons ignites the spark of 'I am'. It is as if we are running outdated software on cutting-edge hardware—our bodies evolved for survival, yet our spirits yearn for eternity, prompting us to chase stars through telescopes or code AI overlords, all while forgetting the universe's blueprint is etched in our very breath.<br><br>Building on this foundation, at the heart of the shift lies the 'Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,' not merely a tale of temptation but a profound symbol of duality's birth. Picture it as a cosmic decision tree, with each branch splitting reality into 'yes/no,' 'light/dark,' 'self/other,' much like the mind's incessant labeling that chops the seamless flow of existence into pieces. Sufi mystics in Islam describe this as forgetting the oneness of *Tawhid*, where God and creation are inseparable, and by engaging this tree, we slip from the Eternal Now—a state of pure being, akin to the Taoist *Wu Wei* of effortless action in harmony—into the Temporal Script, a scripted drama of time's illusions. In this transition, we cloak ourselves in 'garments of skin,' a Biblical metaphor for the body's sensory suit, reminiscent of Plato's cave dwellers mistaking shadows for truth. Thus, we become 'The Dead': alive in body yet numb to the spirit's pulse, echoing Jesus' words to 'let the dead bury their dead' or the Egyptian Book of the Dead's rituals to awaken the soul beyond the tomb.<br><br>As this numbness takes hold, the illusion deepens through the grand deceiver known as causality, a ghost story we tell ourselves: 'The storm caused the flood, my words caused the hurt.' But peel back the layers, and it is revealed as a mirage, much like in the Aboriginal Dreamtime of Australia, where all events are woven in an eternal web, not chained by cause but sung into being through songlines—correlations of spirit and land. Similarly, quantum physics shows particles entangling across vast distances, influencing without touch and defying the arrow of cause-effect, inviting us to think of life as a grand tapestry rather than a domino chain. In a movie, for instance, the hero's leap doesn't 'cause' the villain's fall; both are threads in the director's vision, and our suffering blooms when we chain correlations into causes, like blaming the mirror for a frown instead of our own expression. Buddhist teachings on *pratītyasamutpāda* (dependent origination) illuminate this further: phenomena arise interdependently, without a first cause, like ripples in a pond merging seamlessly. By shrinking time's gap to zero—Δt → 0—the illusion shatters, ushering in the mystical 'now' of Eckhart Tolle or the Sufi *fana* (annihilation of self in divine presence), where past regrets and future fears dissolve into pure presence, and every moment correlates in divine symmetry.<br><br>With this understanding of illusion in mind, consider your body as a temple, not a prison—a layered sanctuary housing the divine spark, envisioned as stacked realms much like the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model in computer networking. The physical body serves as the earthen foundation, 'dust of the earth' in Genesis or the Hindu *annamaya kosha* (food sheath), sustaining life through flesh and bone, while cellular bonds form invisible threads.

    "Eternal Now (Copilot Version)": "Have you ever paused in a quiet moment and felt the world tilt, as if a veil lifted and the rush of life revealed itself as a passing dream? This is an invitation to remember: to trace how ancient wisdom, modern science, and simple practice converge on one discovery—that presence is the ground beneath all stories.<br><br>Imagine a garden where every leaf whispers unity. One bite, one choice, and the seamless field fractures into names and oppositions. Myths call this The Fall: Eden’s forbidden fruit, the Popol Vuh’s forgetting, Maya’s veil. Across traditions the same pattern appears—an original forgetting that turns the living whole into a world of parts. Modern thought names the puzzle differently: the Hard Problem of Consciousness, the mystery of how matter gives rise to the felt “I.” Yet both point to the same paradox: we are running ancient survival software on a machine built for luminous awareness.<br><br>At the heart of the split stands the Tree of Knowledge, a symbol of duality’s birth. Each branch bifurcates reality into yes/no, self/other, cause/effect—an endless labeling that slices the present into past and future. Mystics call this forgetting the One: Tawhid in Sufism, Neti Neti in the Upanishads, Wu Wei in Taoism. We clothe ourselves in sensory suits—garments of skin—and mistake the costume for the actor. Alive in body, many of us are dead to presence.<br><br>Causality, too, is a story we tell. We chain events into linear causes and effects and thereby manufacture suffering. Indigenous cosmologies and quantum experiments both suggest a different grammar: events as interwoven patterns, not dominoes. Dependent origination teaches that phenomena arise in relation, not from a single first cause. Shrink the interval between stimulus and response—let Δt → 0—and the illusion of time thins. In that thinning, the mystical now appears: a place where regret and fear dissolve and the self softens into participation.<br><br>See your body as a temple, layered like a living architecture. The physical sheath grounds you; breath and nervous system move energy through channels named prana, qi, or simply life. The vagus nerve is Jacob’s ladder—messenger and mediator—while the claustrum and cerebrospinal flow hint at how consciousness is woven into tissue and rhythm. These are not metaphors alone; they are invitations to practice the body as a sacred instrument.<br><br>Geometry teaches the same lesson in symbol. The horizontal wheel—twelve spokes of habit, calendar, and doing—keeps us circling. The vertical pillar—seven steps of ascent, chakras, or days of creation—calls us to stillness. The glitch is spinning the wheel without climbing the pillar. Align the two and the music of the spheres becomes audible again.<br><br>So how do we return? Begin with subtraction: simplify until essence remains. Practice the mirror—see the outer world as a reflection of inner states. Collapse lag between stimulus and response through embodied presence: breathe, hum, and soften. Use the lullaby protocol—gentle breath, low tone, visualized light—to soothe inflammation and invite the nervous system to rest. Build a daily ritual: morning alignment to center the spine and intention; evening gratitude to integrate insight into life. These are small calibrations that retune the temple.<br><br>This is not escape but remembrance. The Second Coming is not an event to wait for but a quiet collapse into unity that happens when attention stops feeding the script of time. Whether you name it Christ’s return, the Atman’s dawn, or simply waking up, it is the same movement: consciousness recognizing itself. In that recognition the Eternal Now is not an idea but a lived reality—simple, immediate, and whole."
